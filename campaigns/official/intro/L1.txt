================================================================================
LEVEL DATA FILE - INTRODUCTION LEVEL 1
================================================================================

Level Name: The name of the level revealed to the player
Level Description: The description of the level that is revealed to the player,
	if hints are enabled. (try to fit this in a single screen)
Level Password: The password necessary to instantly reach the level. Passwords
	must be alphabetic (A-Z), and must contain eight characters.
Alternatively, the password may contain eight pluses (+) to signify that this
	level is not accessible via password, but that continues are still allowed,
	or contain eight minuses (-) to disallow continuing (will place a
	red Fatal! in the password region to remind players of this).
Level game number: The variations that comprise this number. Valid numbers are:
    1 - Powerups
    2 - Extra Height
    8 - Double Juggling: The player starts each life with two balls
   16 - Cavity: Any reasonably sized (2x2-4x4) holes will have a ball placed in it.
	They cannot damage bricks while trapped, but will aid you once freed.
   32 - Progressive: Blocks shift down by row, increasing in frequency as more blocks
	are cleared. Late enough in a life, this shift can occur with EACH paddle bounce.
	Overrides Cavity
   64 - Steerable: The paddle's movement will influence any balls that are
	moving away from the paddle. Care should be taken when using invincible blocks
  128 - Invisible: The blocks are invisible, and only become momentarily visible
	when a block gets hit
  256 - Hyper Speed: All balls move as if they were 50% faster
  512 - Boss Battle: The first block set works differently, with the ZAP value
	indicating boss health. Subsequent ZAP values indicate what to revert to
	indicate damage.
 1024 - Rotation: Blocks will rotate constantly. Invincible blocks are not moved,
	and other blocks are moved around them. Overrides Cavity
 4096 - Shrink Ceiling: The first time a ball bounces off the ceiling, the paddle
	shrinks.
16384 - Fatal Timer: the timer is fatal, and will end the game if it runs out
32768 - Bonus: The player can earn extra points, but the level ends as soon
	as all the blocks are destroyed, or if a life is lost. Lives lost in any
	bonus level are returned to the player for use in future levels.
	Overrides Fatal Timer
These numbers may be added together to enable multiple variations, except
	when noted otherwise. Can also be written as &b0000000000000000 (binary format).
	
Level time limit: How many seconds to allow completing the level. Unless specified
	above, if time runs out, a life will be lost, and the rest of the level skipped.
	Overrides warp level mecahnics. Set to 0 to disable. On settings easier than
	Medium-Easy (3.5), the timer is doubled to accommodate slower play

Number of Block Sets: How many block sets the level has (max 35)
--- Block Set specs ---
Set X Color: The color of the blocks that belong to the set. Must be specified
	in hexadecimal format using "&hAARRGGBB". Alternatively, may be set to 0
	for invisible blocks
Set X Score Value: The score value of the blocks that belong to the set. May
	be marked with an asterisk to denote dynamic value
Set X Hit Degrade: The block set to degrade a member to when hit. If set to 0,
	then the block will be destroyed. If negative, the block will explode.
Set X Increase Speed: If true, then the ball's speed will increase faster.
	Additionally, if the ball speed is not already +50% the starting speed,
	then ball speed is immediately increased to that amount!
    
---- Special Degrade notes----
* Invincible blocks may be made by setting the degrade to equal to the
    current pallete.
* If metal balls are active, then all blocks hit are destroyed regardless
    of their hit degrade setting.
* Can be set to regenerate by marking it with an asterisk.
	(such blocks do not change progression towards trapped balls)
* A "infinite" loop may be made by setting a couple of brick sets' degrades to equal
    each other. (e.g. blocks sets 2 and 3 whose hit degrades are set to each other
    constitute an infinite loop). Such blocks will give points and spawn powerups
    indefinitely, but otherwise count as true invincible blocks
    (they do not count towards level progression, and still contributes towards
    trapped balls).

--- End Block Set specs ---

Below the specs is the level grid, which is built using the specs above. The
	grid can be either 20x20, or 40x20, depending on the header size. In order
	to use block sets 10-35, values A-Z are required.
