## Nebunoid Cheats

Nebunoid comes with a collection of cheat codes, accessed via F11 while the game is running. Cheat codes which alter gameplay require acknowledgement that they will disqualify high scores and void experience earnings before they can be used.

* NexTrack: Skips to the next song in the playlist.
* LevelAxe: Resets level progress and makes the game forget passwords. Fair warning; this will also cause secret levels to be forgotten, and stars to be lost.
* IwantToPlay: Adds a new player to the match. If difficulty is low enough, will use the lowest current level of the existing players. Max 4 players in a match.
* PumpkinEater: Expresses acknowledgement that the player(s) are cheating. Required to activate any cheat code underneath.
* Immortal: Adds 3 lives to the active player's stock.
* BiggiePaddle: Extends paddle size by 70 pixels.
* CapShower: Attempts to generate a barrage of capsules. (Subject to current level specs, difficulty settings, and Diminishing Returns.)
* WarpAway: Exits the current level.
* BackInTime: Restarts the current level.
* TimeFrost: Activates or amplifies a Blizzard effect.
* CurveDown: Activates Gravity Balls effect(s).

If a player misspells after expressing acknowledgement, the active player will be dealt a random punishment.
